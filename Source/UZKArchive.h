 *
 *  @param filePath  The full path to the target file in the archive
 *  @param fileDate  The timestamp of the file in the archive. Uses the current time if nil
 *  @param method    The UZKCompressionMethod to use (Default, None, Fastest, Best)
 *  @param overwrite If YES, and the file exists, delete it before writing. If NO, append
 *                   the data into the archive without removing it first (legacy Objective-Zip
 *                   behavior)
 *  @param preCRC    The CRC-32 for the data being sent. Only necessary if encrypting the file.
                     Pass 0 otherwise
 *  @param password  Override the password associated with the archive (not recommended)
 *  @param error     Contains an NSError object when there was an error writing to the archive
 *  @param action    Contains your code to loop through the source bytes and write them to the
 *                   archive. Each time a chunk of data is ready to be written, call writeData,
 *                   passing in a pointer to the bytes and their length. Return YES if successful,
 *                   or NO on error (in which case, you should assign the actionError parameter
 *
 *       - *writeData*   Call this block to write some bytes into the archive. It returns NO if the
 *                       write failed. If this happens, you should return from the action block, and
 *                       handle the NSError returned into the error reference
 *       - *actionError* Assign to an NSError instance before returning NO
 *
 *  @return YES if successful, NO on error
